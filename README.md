# AIR QUALITY PREDICTION
  Humans are highly responsive to humidity since the skin depends on air to eliminate moisture. Sweating is the body's mechanism to regulate temperature by staying cool. When air reaches 100-percent relative humidity, sweat doesn't evaporate. Consequently, high relative humidity makes us perceive higher temperatures. Conversely, low humidity can make us feel cooler as sweat evaporates easily, providing cooling. For instance, at an air temperature of 75°F (24°C) and zero percent humidity, it feels like 69°F (21°C). However, with 100 percent humidity, it feels like 80°F (27°C). Thus, we aim to forecast Relative Humidity using other influencing factors.
  So, we will predict the Relative Humidity of a given point of time based on all other attributes affecting the change in RH.

# Dataset 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality

  The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensory Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year) representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. Ground Truth hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and were provided by a co-located reference certified analyser. Evidence of cross-sensitivities as well as both concept and sensor drifts are present as described in De Vito et al., Sens. And Act. B, Vol. 129,2,2008 (citation required) eventually affecting sensors concentration estimation capabilities. Missing values are tagged with -200 value.
